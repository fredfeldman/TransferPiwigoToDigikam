My first public repository

Used Github Chat to make this app, and compiled in Visual Studio Community 2026.

I was able to run on my Piwigo website and got most of the files to my local computer.  I had 89 files out of 9000 fail to transfer.  Going to look into why the 89 files did not transfer.

FYI - To get the program to work, edit this file "include/config_default.Inc.php".  Change $conf['show_php_errors'] = E_ALL; to $conf['show_php_errors'] = '';  Then put back after you run the utility.

This app is without waranty, and you are free to use or modify.
